# 100-prisoners-problem
Quick and dirty, but efficient code for simulating 100 prisoners riddle.

I made it, like some other people I saw on GitHub, because I watched a Veritasium video on YouTube.
I had my fun for a few hours with it and I decided to put it here for archivization.

I will accept pull requests.
If someone knows why average chance of prisoners converges to  31.20% instead of 30.685% (which is 1 - ln(2)) please put in a pull request.
My guess is either my estimate is wrong or it has something to do with RNG algorithm, but I'm just guessing. Thanks in advance ;)
